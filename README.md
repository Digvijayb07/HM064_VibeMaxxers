---

## **📌 Purpose of the Website**

**TalentHub** is a project-based collaboration platform that connects **companies** with **developers** through transparent, skill-driven workflows. Instead of traditional hiring, companies post real projects and developers compete by submitting proposals and solutions.

### **How It Works?**
- Companies create projects with clear requirements, tech stack, budget, and deadlines.  
- Developers browse projects and submit proposals with portfolio links.  
- Companies shortlist or reject applicants transparently.  
- Shortlisted developers submit project solutions.  
- One winner is selected per project, while other shortlisted developers receive participation acknowledgment.  

### **How It Helps Institutions / Organizations?**
- Promotes **project-based hiring** over resume screening.  
- Ensures **fair evaluation** based on real work submissions.  
- Helps organizations identify **practical, job-ready talent**.
